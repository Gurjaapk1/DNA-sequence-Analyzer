This is a simple dan sequence analyzer that examines the 
	number of nucleotides present in your desired fasta file
	GC content present in each file
	Reverse Complement of each DNA sequence
	RNA sequence for each gene

This is all exported to the output file. 
The program works on a relative import, and therefore the command to run this program is:

python3 -m Scripts.__main__ --input Sequences/ --output Results.txt

For the segment --input, you can add whatever files you use to the "Sequences" folder in order to analyze your Desired DNA sequence/sequences that you would like to compare. My program is primarily meant to compare multiple sequences.
